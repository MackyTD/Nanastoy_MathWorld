"""
Run the math adventure.

How this game works.
You, the player, will spawn at the middle of the math world and need to find
the randomly generated portal at the corner by navigating through this
dimension by typing in up, down, left or right when the player is prompted with
the question. There are also chests and maps along the way that you can choose
to interact with it, spending the valuable actions. You can get something
useful or detrimental to your journey, it's all up to luck when opening a chest
As for the map, you can spend your valuable actions to determine the distance
between you and your home, helping you make the right moves.

Once an action threshold has been reached, the player will be greeted
with the professor, and the action counter will reset. All Decision matter!

Good Luck!
