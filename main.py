Run the math adventure.

You are playing a student who is struggling with an upcoming exam, so you look
upon the internet for some practice problems. You find a mysterious maths
website called “Nanastoy’s math world”. You click on the website and see a
strange bright light coming out of your screen. The bright light teleports you
into the strange dimension - Nanastoy's Math World. To go back to your
normal world, you need to search for the “exit portal”, located randomly in the
4 corners of the math world. However; while you are searching for the portal,
you will need to encounter the “math monsters” and “The professor Nanastoy”.
There will also be loot boxes that contain both good and bad items,
so you will have to pray for good fortunes. Can you take on the challenges of
the math world and make it out alive, or will you die trying, stuck in the
alternate reality forever...
