You are playing a student who is struggling with an upcoming exam, so you look
upon the internet for some practice problems. You find a mysterious maths
website called “Nanastoy’s math world”. You click on the website and see a
strange bright light coming out of your screen. The bright light teleports you
into the strange dimension - Nanastoy's Math World. To go back to your
normal world, you need to search for the “exit portal”, located randomly in the
4 corners of the math world. However; while you are searching for the portal,
you will need to encounter the “math monsters” and “The professor Nanastoy”.
There will also be loot boxes that contain both good and bad items,
so you will have to pray for good fortunes. Can you take on the challenges of
the math world and make it out alive, or will you die trying, stuck in the
alternate reality forever...


How to play this game?

You, the player, will spawn at the middle of the math world and need to find
the randomly generated portal at the corner by navigating through this dimension
by typing in up, down, left or right when the player is prompted with the question.
There are also chests along the way that you can choose whether you want to spend
your valuable "action" on.

All actions except for fighting the monsters and the professor will be counted as
an action, and once an action threshold has been reached, the player will be greeted
with the professor, and the action counter will reset. Decision matter!

Good Luck, and Have Fun!
